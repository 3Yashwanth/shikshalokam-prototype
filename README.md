# shikshalokam-prototype
AI powered Teacher monitoring and student feedback app.

This project is an AI-based teacher training feedback system designed to analyze recorded teaching sessions, provide AI-driven insights, allow mentor interactions, and track teacher improvements.

It includes four main sections:

Training Feedback - AI compares teacher recordings with ideal training videos and provides similarity scores.
Talk to Mentor - Teachers can call, message, or request help from mentors.
Student Outcome Tracking - Student answers (video responses) are analyzed, and AI gives performance insights.
My Feedback - Headmasters & mentors provide manual feedback for teachers, helping them improve.
How It Works
1 Training Feedback Page (training-feedback.html)
Displays recorded training videos & compares them with the ideal training session.
AI provides similarity percentage for teaching skills, pronunciation, and implementation.
Helps teachers understand where to improve with visual percentage bars.
➡ Clicking on a recording opens the AI feedback modal.

2 Talk to Mentor Page (talk-to-mentor.html)
Lists three mentors along with their name & designation.
Teachers can:
 Call the mentor 
 Message the mentor 
 Request personalized help 
➡ Clicking on a button redirects to a chat or call interface.

3 Student Outcome Tracking Page (student-outcome.html)
Shows student responses (videos) for viva or Q&A sessions.
